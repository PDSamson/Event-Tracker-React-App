This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a new version of my [Event Tracker App](https://github.com/PDSamson/event-tracker-browser).  This App allows users to sign in and create events stored in the API using a dynamically managed user interface built using ReactJS.

I built this app based on my previous practice with the React framework.  I recreated each function of my previous app and tied what displayed on the page to React states, allowing me to avoid the direct Jquery calls used in my previous app.

I managed the difficulties I encountered by researching React online both through the Udemy course I learned React from and stackoverflow among other resources.
